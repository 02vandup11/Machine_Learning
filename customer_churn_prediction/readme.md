# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn refers to the loss of customers when they stop using a company’s product or service.
This project builds an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical data.

The objective is to help businesses identify at-risk customers early and take proactive retention measures.
