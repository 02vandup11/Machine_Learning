# Decision Tree Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project implements a **Decision Tree Classifier** using Python to solve a supervised classification problem.  
It demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## Objectives
- Understand the Decision Tree algorithm  
- Prepare data for machine learning  
- Train and test a classification model  
- Evaluate model performance  
- Interpret results  

---

## Algorithm Used
**Decision Tree Classifier**

A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm that splits data into subsets based on feature values.  
Splitting is performed using impurity measures such as **Gini Impurity** or **Entropy (Information Gain)** to improve classification accuracy.

## Steps Performed
1. Imported required Python libraries  
2. Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame  
3. Performed initial data exploration  
4. Handled missing or inconsistent values (if any)  
5. Selected features and target variable  
6. Split data into training and testing sets  
7. Trained the Decision Tree Classifier  
8. Made predictions on test data  
9. Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification metrics  
10. Visualized the results and model behavior

## Model Evaluation
The model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-Score
