# Random Forest & SVM Classification Project

## Overview
This project implements and compares two supervised machine learning algorithms:
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

The notebook demonstrates a complete classification workflow including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization using Python.

---

## Objectives
- Build classification models using Random Forest and SVM  
- Understand differences between ensemble-based and margin-based algorithms  
- Evaluate and compare model performance  
- Visualize model results for better interpretation  

---

## Algorithms Used

### Random Forest Classifier
Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.

**Key characteristics:**
- Uses multiple decision trees  
- Reduces variance through averaging  
- Handles non-linear data well  

---

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that finds an optimal decision boundary (hyperplane) with maximum margin between classes.

**Key characteristics:**
- Margin-based classification  
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces  
- Uses support vectors for decision making

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Steps Performed
1. Imported required Python libraries  
2. Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame  
3. Performed basic data exploration  
4. Prepared features and target variable  
5. Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
6. Trained the **Random Forest Classifier**  
7. Trained the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model  
8. Generated predictions on test data  
9. Evaluated both models using classification metrics  
10. Visualized results to compare model performance  

---

## Model Evaluation
Both models are evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)  

---

## Visualizations
The notebook includes visualization steps to:
- Represent model performance  
- Support comparison between Random Forest and SVM  
- Improve interpretability of results  

---

## Results
- Both Random Forest and SVM models successfully perform classification  
- Random Forest handles complex feature interactions effectively  
- SVM provides strong margin-based classification  

---

## How to Run
